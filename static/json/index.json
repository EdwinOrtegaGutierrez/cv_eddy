        "Throughout my university career, I have demonstrated outstanding skills in developing scalable projects and quick learning, always maintaining a focus on clean code. My experience includes working with server-side applications, with particular attention to databases, data validation, and user type validations. As well as with client-side, in designing the graphical interface, presenting specific data for each type of user, mobility of visual data, and data visualization. Currently, I am working on the Mars Rover UDG Space project in the autonomy area since August 2022. Additionally, I have developed web and desktop applications, and gained experience in detecting ArUco codes and implementing navigation algorithms for robotics. My focus is always on creating efficient solutions, with high performance and quality in their development, and working as a team to achieve goals. I am always looking for new opportunities to continue growing and improving my skills in the field of computer science"
